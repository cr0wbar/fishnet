fishnet
=======
Fishnet is a simple utility to find torrents. It aggregates results from different providers, which can be loaded remotely or locally, and displays them. The user can then copy the URL and/or the magnet link to the clipboard and do whatever he/she wants with it. Really, is just as simple as it sounds. It is also possible to search by category for a single provider, or search using all available providers in all categories. When gathering results from all providers it can display the results in a single tab (as 'Aggregated') or in different tabs, one for each provider.
